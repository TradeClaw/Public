# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
If you have additional questions, feel free to leave them in the Discord channel dedicated to that and we'd be happy to answer them.

### What is TradeClaw?
TradeClaw is the 3rd iteration of a platform that generates trading signals and automated follow-up on those signal in the form of a trading bot. 

### Where is the TradeClaw community?
You can find us on Discord:\
https://discord.gg/9H226nX  \
\
We made this choice to make it manageable and easy to moderate. \
The trading space on the internet is filled with false promises, fake portfolio management services and ponzi schemes so we want to avoid our users being scammed on our watch!

### What is the track record of v1/v2 of TradeClaw?
The platform is profitable, over 65% of trades close green monthly and drawdown has been limited due to the fact that everything is automated and enhanced over the years with features to uphold a good strategy. \
There is a reporting feature on the roadmap to be as transparant as possible.

### Why did you start work on a 3rd version if the current v2 works well?
TradeClaw v1 started out of curiosity, some of us have been trading for years but mostly for the fun of it, understanding how it works without taking it too serious or giving up our jobs. \
TradeClaw v2 was a complete rework of the monolith that the first version became, focused on performance and reducing resource usage. \
TradeClaw v3 takes the best elements of the currently running version and augments it with a highly scalable design.

### Why would you share such a platform?
This question has been on our minds for a long time, why... \
The platform works and this provides a new challenge in exposing what we have been working on for years.

### Do you offer financial services?
No, we do not offer financial services nor any financial advice.

### What are the community guidelines?
The rules are:
* No promoting other projects!
* No offering of services or financial advice to anyone.
* No swearing, no trolling, no insulting, show respect!
* Do not mock others that have an other level of understanding than yourself, help them grow instead.

### Does TradeClaw do arbitrage?
For some reason there is a popular belief in arbitrage, we have done the experiments and analysis over the years and do not find any viable reason to participate in that field.

### Who are you?
Today privacy is a rare gift, we do not share our identities for a number of reasons and advice you to do the same, identity theft is no laughing matter.

### What happens if you get shut down?
Nothing, the platform will still exist without its website or what not. \
We will never manage your funds in our accounts so nobody can lose anything, a choice made to minimize risk even though there is nothing illegal about TradeClaw.

### Why are you having a free membership possibility?
As stated above, TradeClaw is about showing our work to the world and what better way to do this than sharing some for free? \
This free or basic membership has its limitations and the signals are delayed compared to the paid counterparts. \
The higher tier members have the ability to make requests for features and get priority in support, whereas the basic members receive a best effort service based on the availability of our support staff.

### Can I get an invoice? Are you a VAT registered business?
We currently do not offer invoices or other B2B aspects, feel free to check in with us via a support ticket to see if this has changed.

### How will payment be done and how much is it?
Our preference will be cryptocurrency as a way of paying for membership but this has not been worked out at the time of writing. \
We have decided to only offer monthly subscriptions because we are sure our product quality is good and we do not need to lure anyone in with a 'limited offer' yearly payment option. 

### Will you have a referral or MLM option?
Short answer: yes. \
At least for a chance of earning a higher tier membership or getting a percentage off, we are still investigating other possibilities. \
We know these terms sound 'scammy' but it's a good self-sustaining way of spreading the word, a user convinced of the quality of the product will bring in other valuable members for our community and there will be a reward for that effort.

### Are you open to working together or any business offers?
We have been in this space for a long time and know the drill, most of the inquiries are not legit or will not benefit anything on TradeClaw. \
We are NOT looking to pay for social media marketing, promotion or shout outs. \
Of course we are open to serious business offers with a mutual benefit.

### Am I allowed to join the TradeClaw platform as a resident of my country?
The responsibility of knowing whether or not you are allowed to use our services, lies with you. \
To our knowledge we will not provide any service that is illegal anywhere in the world.

### Will KYC be required for the TradeClaw platform?
No, there aren't any services on the roadmap that require KYC registration.

### How do you protect our data?
TradeClaw is designed to work as trustless as possible, none of our systems are directly accessible from the internet and everything is encrypted in the database.

### Will there be a multi-lingual interface or community?
As the platform grows this will become a higher priority, for now all information and communication will be in english. \
Active members that want to earn a higher tier membership can always translate, this will be peer-reviewed before being accepted to avoid poor quality Google Translate text.

### How can I actively help out? Is there a reward for active members?
We currently are putting together a list of things we consider being helpful or active:
* Translation (Interface)
* Translation (Discord)
* Translation (Documentation)
* Moderation (Discord)
* Support (Tickets)
* Support (Discord)
* Community building (Discord)
* Ambassador (Instagram)
* Ambassador (Twitter)
* Ambassador (Facebook)
* Ambassador (Youtube)
* Ambassador (Articles/Blogging) 

And yes, there will be rewards for all of these actions but they will have to be of high quality, especially the ambassador work can not be spamming or copy/pasting the same things all over.

### What can I do with the TradeClaw trading signals?
Trading signals are commonly used by traders as BUY/SELL signals, if you are unfamiliar with this mechanic then we happily redirect you to Youtube which contains an almost endless supply of videos on the matter. \
It is very important you know how to manage risk and size positions before making real trades, some platforms offer a demo or test version to play around and we highly recommend doing that!

### How does TradeClaw calculate those signals?
This will not be revealed since this is the algorithm we have developed and fine-tuned over the years.

### How can I be certain you won't abuse my API keys needed for the trading bot service?
In all honesty, we can't give you any certainty since there is some trust required and our reputation will build up over time. \
You can always stick to using the trading signals and executing the trades yourself, there is no obligation in using the bot service. \
It's also a good idea to create a separate account on the trading platform of your choice, if their terms allow it.

### Will there be an ICO/IPO or any other investment offering?
No, we do not need any investment to launch the TradeClaw platform, it provides its own funds for covering operational costs.

### Is this a cryptocurrency or blockchain platform?
At the time of writing, only payment options will likely be cryptocurrency based. \
This does not exclude anything in the future if the technology is needed.

### Do you have or use a cryptocurrency token?
No, we do not have plans to create a token but do not exclude the possibility in the future.

### Which markets will TradeClaw provide signals or bot services for?
There are no limits to which markets or instruments we can onboard in TradeClaw, feel free to make suggestions. \
You can find our most recent roadmap of the platforms we support or plan on supporting, in the README or changelog.
* Cryptocurrency
* Stocks
* Forex

### Is there an insurance fund for losses caused by the TradeClaw bot service?
No, there are no plans of creating an insurance fund because the TradeClaw bot service is not a financial service and not every trade will be profitable, we do not make any promises in the monthly profit it will make for you and patience is going to be your best friend. \
People claiming differently and offering 50% weekly gains or 9 out of 10 trades closing in profit, are probably not worth your trust. \
TradeClaw will always run two versions of the code, only the long-term stable version will be used for users and the new releases are deployed for the internal accounts.

### What is the (Application/Infrastructure) design of TradeClaw?
For security reasons this will not be disclosed. \
Every member of our team has been working in the datacenter and service provider business for at least 15 years, TradeClaw is built on a ton of experience!

### What happens with open trades if I change the assets or funds on my trading platform account?
TradeClaw will show which and how many assets/funds are needed for it to function properly, if you change this while the bot service is active and a trade is in progress, you are risking failure on mechanics like average down orders. \
When a trade opens, your account situation regarding the asset will be checked and logged in our database for full tracking of what went wrong in case of failure.

### Will TradeClaw allow me to choose my preferred indicators or strategies?
Yes and no, there will be proprietary flavors to chose from depending on your preference in risk. \
There won't be indicators or 'build your own strategy' tools in our platform, the goal is to make it as easy as possible.
